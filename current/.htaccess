##		There are several ways of doing clean URLs in Textpattern.
##		You can use "messy" URLs and apply some Rewrite rules
##		Or
## 	The idea is to have an extentionless file execute as php.

## 	In Apache, you can set the DefaultType to whatever your php
## 	is called, for example

DefaultType application/x-httpd-php
#DefaultType application/x-httpd-fastphp
#DefaultType application/x-isapi-php


##		You can also use content negiotiation. A feature in most web servers
##		including Apache, Zeus and Windows.
##		In this one,  you put the extension section file, content negotiation allows
##		a file with an extension to be called up in a URL without the extension.
##		http://yourdomain.com/about.php is accessible from http://yourdomain.com/about/

## 	This is generally a default setting in Zeus, and with Apache you'll need
##		mod_negiotiation enabled and use the following in http.conf or .htaccess

Options +Multiviews

##		Finally another way is to Force a file to be php.
##		The following will Force extensionless files to be executed as php.
##		Another way is to force extensionless files to be php (whatever the server calls it.)
##		

<FilesMatch "^([^\.]+)$">
ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

## 	Adding this line can make it run as mod_php
##		AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm .php
