This svn branch that you are using ( /current ) will soon disappear and
instead /stable/4.0 will be used. That is the svn banch where all future 
check-ins for the 4.0 branch will go. You can find more information on 
the weblog at http://textpattern.com/weblog/15/svn-reorganization 

Be aware that it is recommended to use the RELEASES from the DOWNLOAD 
page, rather than subversion for a production site, since releases 
tend to be better tested and less likely to contain errors.
This will also make giving and receiving support on the forums easier.

IF you want to continue using svn, please use the following command in 
your working directory (which is where this file should be):

--------------------------------------------------

 svn switch http://svn.textpattern.com/stable/4.0 

--------------------------------------------------
