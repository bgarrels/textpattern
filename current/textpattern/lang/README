LANGUAGE FILES

All language strings that are used by Textpattern, remain in the database 
as of 1.0RC4 (and later). You can change your language by selecting from 
the installed languages in "admin -> preferences". To install additional 
languages you can go to "admin -> preferences -> Install Language". The 
preferred and default method of installation is to query a remote server 
(belonging to textpattern) to ensure that you always get the most recent 
set of languages in their most recent state that is available.

In case your Server is not connected to the Internet, the fallback method
is to install from the files that are in this directory. Please be aware 
that these languages may well be outdated and some newer language strings 
may be missing. 

If you are interested in translating Textpattern into your
own language, we would like to your from you on our forums at 
http://www.textpattern.com/ .
